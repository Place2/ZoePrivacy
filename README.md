-   The bot has several `setup` commands, executing one of these commands will save data from that `setup`.

### <font color="cyan">What data is stored? </font>

-   We only store IDs, the ID is used to retrieve further data needed from the Discord API with the ID depending on the function when used, further data than the ID is not stored.

### <font color="cyan">Temporary data </font>

-   Cached data is not stored and is deleted at least every month on restart

### <font color="cyan">When and how can I delete my data? </font>

-   As a server owner, collected data is only retained as long as the bot is on the server. If the bot is removed from the server, all stored data is deleted from the server. User-related, all data will be deleted if the user is out of reach of our bot, i.e. the user does not share a server with the bot.
